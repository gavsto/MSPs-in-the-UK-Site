# MSPs in the UK

I ([Gavin Stone](https://gavsto.com)) founded MSPs in the UK because I saw there was a huge gap for live, UK specific discussion. As a Managing Partner of [MSPGeek](https://mspgeek.org) I have spent a lot of time interacting worldwide with thousands of MSPs and having a UK specific space has been a dream for years. Things like pricing, insurance, compliancy, security (Cyber Essentials etc) and even sectors to some degree are all different in the UK. All people are welcome from starting MSPs to established MSPs. The only thing we ask is that you are UK MSP
